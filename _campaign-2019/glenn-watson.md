# .NET Foundation Campaign: Glenn Watson

## Why I'm Running
So I have taken over the ReactiveUI project, which is part of the DotNet foundation about 9 months ago now. I have also worked on large software projects for C# and .NET over the last 10 years for several large companies.

During that time I have had a number of issues that I would like to directly have a opportunity to fix for ReactiveUI and other projects out there.

First a lot of the processes at the moment for the teams are very manual orientated. Asking for software or server based tech takes a bit of time to organize. Since humans with real jobs are the bottleneck at the moment I would like to make their lives easier and automated a lot of that stuff. We can use GitHub much more in our nomination processes. I want to find a way of getting resources out to our foundation members in a fast, fair and economical way.

It's a bit unclear what the board can achieve and what they are doing. I would like to beef up the communication with the community. We can run the DotNet foundation much more like a open source project. Use tools such as Gitter for communication where appropriate (such as communication that should be public), and just getting the information out there. 

I also come from a diversity background, being a member of the LGBT community. One thing that is important to me though is that this is about making the foundation better and want any vote that comes my way be based on the merit of my campaign and not just based on this fact.
