That's great! Here's the information you need to decide if you'd like to move forward.

## Who Can Run for a Board Seat?

Any [voting member](https://dotnetfoundation.org/blog/2019/01/14/why-you-should-join-part-1-join-as-a-voting-member) can run for a board seat. That’s anyone who’s contributed to a .NET Foundation project and [applied for membership](https://dotnetfoundation.org/become-a-member).

## Who Should Run for The Board?

Well, we need seven people to run the show. We’d love to see seven people with different viewpoints and experiences. **We’d love to see a lot of diversity! We’d love to see people who represent different development backgrounds and concerns – not just .NET open source veterans, but people who speak for students, startups, new developers, corporate developers. We’d love to see folks who speak for different platforms, operating systems, web, desktop, games, IoT. We’d love to see people we haven’t thought to ask.** The board is seven people instead of one because we need more viewpoints.

If you’ve had long conversations on Twitter, at conferences, or with developer friends about the way .NET open source ought to be, you’ve got an important viewpoint, and this is where you can make that change.

## What’s Expected of Board Members?

The board actively manages the foundation and gets involved in new initiatives. Here’s what that looks like:

*   Monthly meetings with the board and executive director to keep up with what’s going on and set plans
*   Review and approve requests for new projects to join

**Form committees and get stuff done! Committees are an area where you can really have a personal impact on things you really care about.** This will include some general committees for businessy things (like membership and elections), as well as some special purpose committees that are up to you (maybe student outreach, Meetups, game development on .NET, diversity, conferences, etc.). We have a budget and a community that wants to get involved, so it’s not about you signing up for a lot of work here, it’s mostly about vision, planning and organizing.

## I’m Interested in Running, But I’m Not Sure I Can Do It…

If in doubt, go for it!

If you’re feeling unqualified, remember that we’re looking for a board that represents a lot of backgrounds, and that includes experience levels. The important thing is that you’ve got a passion for .NET open source and are willing to show up to make it a better place.

If you’re worried about the time commitment – well, it’s true, we need you to be available and to put in the time. I’m not expecting a major time commitment – probably 4-6 hours a month, and most of it can be over e-mail and on your own schedule.

If there’s something preventing you from joining the .NET Foundation as a voting member to be eligible to run in the election, talk to us! Our [previous post on joining as a voting member](https://dotnetfoundation.org/blog/2019/01/14/why-you-should-join-part-1-join-as-a-voting-member) hopefully explains why contributions or dues shouldn’t get in your way.

## Okay, I'm In! What Do I Do Next?

Yay! Okay, you'll need to submit a campaign statement to let us know you're running and get listed on the site. We've got a template started for you, but this is your page, so feel free to be creative. We plan to approve and post these within one business day, and any make any edits (via pull request) withing one business day as well.

Here's an [example campaign statement](/example.html) to get you started.
